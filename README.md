# Project-One

### This is a webapp to help students streamline the process of organizing study meetups.

* Fill out the form with name, location, and how long user would like to study for
* On form submission, user will see a map of their fellow students and current location, as well as a list of fellow students to choose to meetup with
* Upon choosing a classmate to meet with, a new map will populate with study spots between the two of users.

This was the first group project assigned during the Coding BootCamp class in December 2018 and was originally names as "SAKI study" based on our first name initials.
* Suzanne Hunter (Front-end: Bootstrap, CSS, Colors)
* Alex Kluger (Back-end: Form validation and Yelp API AJAX calls)
* Kevin Bray (Front and Back-end: Moment)
* Ize Imai (Back-end: TomTom, Leaflet, Midpoint math, Firebase clearing and local storage)

In this forked version, I made changes to the front-end to better match my monochromatic/minimalist taste and plan to use Node.js to hide my APIs rather than post them in GitHub.
